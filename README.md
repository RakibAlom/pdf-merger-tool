## 📋 How It Works

### 1. **Client-Side Processing**
The tool uses advanced JavaScript libraries to process PDFs entirely in your browser:
- **PDF.js** renders page previews for visual selection
- **PDF-lib** handles the actual merging and PDF generation
- No data leaves your device, ensuring complete privacy

### 2. **Page Selection Algorithm**
```javascript
// Simplified workflow
1. Upload PDFs → Generate thumbnails → Display previews
2. User selects pages → Store selection state
3. Click merge → Process selected pages → Generate new PDF
4. Download merged document
```

### 3. **Memory Management**
The application efficiently manages memory by:
- Processing PDFs asynchronously
- Generating thumbnails at optimal resolution
- Cleaning up resources after processing

## 🎯 How to Use

### Step 1: Upload PDF Files
- **Drag & Drop**: Simply drag your PDF files onto the upload area
- **Browse Files**: Click "Select PDFs" to choose files from your device
- **Multiple Files**: Upload as many PDFs as needed

### Step 2: Select Pages
- **Visual Preview**: See thumbnail previews of every page
- **Individual Selection**: Click on pages to select/deselect them
- **Bulk Actions**: Use "Select All" or "Deselect All" for quick selection
- **Per-PDF Controls**: Select all pages from specific PDFs

### Step 3: Merge & Download
- **Review Selection**: Ensure you've selected the desired pages
- **Click Merge**: Hit the "Merge PDFs" button to start processing
- **Auto Download**: Your merged PDF will download automatically as "merged-document.pdf"
